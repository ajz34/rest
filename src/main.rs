//! # Rust-based Electronic-Structure Tool (REST)
//! 
//! ### Installation
//!   At present, REST can be compiled in Linux only  
//! 
//!   0) Prerequisites:  
//!     - libopenblas.so  
//!     - libcint.so  
//!     - libhdf5.so  
//!     - libxc.so  
//!   1) git clone git@github.com:igor-1982/rest_workspace.git rest_workspace  
//!   2) cd rest_workspace; cp Config.templet Config
//!   3) edit `Config` to make the prerequeisite libraries aformationed accessable via some global variables heading with `REST`.  
//!   4) bash Config; source $HOME/.bash_profile
//!   5-1) cargo build (--release) 
//! 
//! ### Usage
//!   - Some examples are provided in the folder of `rest/examples/`.  
//!   - Detailed user manual is in preparation.  
//!   - Basic usage of varying keywords can be found on the page of [`InputKeywords`](crate::ctrl_io::InputKeywords).
//! 
//! ### Features
//!   1) Use Gaussian Type Orbital (GTO) basis sets  
//!   2) Provide Density Functional Approximations (DFAs) at varying levels from LDA, GGA, Hybrid, to Fifth-rungs, including doubly hybrid approximations, like XYG3, XYGJ-OS, and random-phase approximation (RPA).  
//!   3) Provide some Wave Function Methods (WFMs), like Hartree-Fock approximation (HF) and Moller-Plesset Second-order perturbation (MP2)
//!   4) Provide analytic electronic-repulsive integrals (ERI)s as well as the Resolution-of-idensity (RI) approximation. The RI algorithm is the recommended choice.  
//!   5) High Share Memory Parallelism (SMP) efficiency
//! 
//! 
//! ### Development
//!   1) Provide a tensor library, namely [`rest_tensors`](https://igor-1982.github.io/rest_tensors/rest_tensors/). `rest_tensors` is developed to manipulate
//!    different kinds multi-rank arrays in REST. Thanks to the sophisticated generic, type, and trait systems, `rest_tensors` can be used as easy as `Numpy` and `Scipy` without losing the computation efficiency. 
//!   2) It is very easy and save to develop a parallel program using the Rust language. Please refer to [`rayon`](rayon) for more details.
//!   3) However, attention should pay if you want to use (Sca)Lapcke functions together in the rayon-spawn threads. 
//!    It is because the (Sca)Lapack functions, like `dgemm`, were compiled with OpenMP by default.  The competetion between OpenMP and Rayon threads 
//!    could dramatically deteriorate the final performance.  
//!    Please use [`utilities::omp_set_num_threads_wrapper`] to set the OpenMP treads number in the runtime.
//!
